# the-ultimate-topic-list

This repo contains all the required data in a structured manner if someone wants to recreate The Ultimate Topic List website: https://youkn0wwho.academy/topic-list

This is intended to make the data public so that when I die and my website dies along with me, then someone can create a new website with the same data.

Sadly I can't make the current website code public because that repo mainly contains my private academy website codes and it is hard to separate the topic list code.

Ultimately data matters, so I am making those public so that in the future my topic list doesn't get lost.

# Guidelines

- `/data/The Ultimate Topic List.txt` contains the data for the main page.
- `/data/The Ultimate Topic List Resources and Templates.txt` contains the data for all resources and templates for each topic.
- `/data/The Ultimate Topic List Problems.txt` contains data for all ~3500 problems and their data and the topics they belong to.

If you want to create a new website, just copy these data and hardcode them as Javascript objects inside your code and that is enough for you to extract relevant data for each page of the website.

Best of luck (after I die)!
